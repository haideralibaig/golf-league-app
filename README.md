### 3. Handicap System

- **Score Tracking**: All scores from tournaments and money games are automatically recorded for handicap purposes.
- **Admin Controls**: Admins can review scores and override handicaps for specific events.

### 4. Player Statistics

- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks key stats like Scoring Average, Fairways in Regulation (FIR), Greens in Regulation (GIR), and Putts Per Round (PPR).
- **Financials**: Tracks money game performance and tournament prize money earned.

### 5. Key Considerations

- **Reusable Components**: The development should focus on building reusable components like scorecards, player profiles to make it easy to build out new playing formats across all categories.
- **Handicapping System**: Any golf app is is only as good as the handicapping system. We must follow this strictly and provide an interactive visual tool for players to understand their handicap calculations, progression, trends and help players work towards reducing and improving their handicap.
- **Social Aspect**: Also we need to think of ways we can involve users on a daily basis using social engineering i.e. give users the ability to comment on score cards, live chat during matches, push notification with key round evens like birdies, bogeys or matchplay events.
- **Golf Club Managemt**: The eventual goal is to make this into a full blown golf course and club management app so we should consider everything from now like Tee Times, Food and Beverage Kiosks or orders, whatever we can do think of a golf course might need to run their business, but a lot of these features will be ear-marked for later to be built.
